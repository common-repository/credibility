Credibility allows you to easily add footnotes to your posts.

== Description ==

While Credibility is not the only plugin that allows you to add footnotes to your posts, it does allow the user to select the placement of these footnotes by:

- Automatically added to the end of content.
- Use a `<php credibility_footnotes_display(); ?>` to display the footnotes where you would like them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why use this plugin? =

This plugin is a simple way to add footnotes to your posts and add credibility (no pun intended) to your website. While there is at least one other option, we needed the ability to put the footnotes anywhere within our theme. For example, in one use case, we wanted to place the footnotes after an optin.
